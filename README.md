## Brief

The purpose of this project is to test how well we can apply the DevOps knowledge gained over the last 10 weeks to deploy a pre-developed application. Full freedom of choice on which tools to use has been given to all group members who must work together to meet the project deliverables by following an agile scrum framework.

### Scope

The scope of this project does not cover development of code as we will be working with externally developed applications:

- front-end: https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular
- back-end: https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest

Please find above the repositories for the well documented 'Spring Pet Clinic' application, one  of which serves as a front end client using AngularJS and the other as an API using Java.

### Requirements

The focuses of this project lies on the automation of the development workflows and the successful deployment of the applicaiton. There is no restrictions or requirements on which tools to use although, the reasons for use of each tool should be discussed in an end-of-project presentation accompanied by a demonstration of the workflows developed. 

## Architecture 

### Application Architecture


### Database Structure

### CI/CD Pipeline


## Project Tracking

Azure Boards were used for project tracking. At the start of the project, an initial Sprint Planning meeting was held. A scrum master was chosen, and the product backlog was filled out with all the functionalities desired in the final product to be completed for the Sprint. Discussions held in this meeting also led to the finalisation on which tools should be used to develop workflows and carry out app deployment. 

Following the agile scrum framework, daily stand-ups held with the scrum team, orchestrated by the scrum master. In this way, every morning team members communicated to the team the work they had completed on the previous working day and any blockers experienced in the process. Issues encountered were listed on the board and systematically labeled as work to be done, doing or done - and moved along accordingly.

## Risk Assessment
A risk assessment was carried out, exploring possible risks, their likelihoods, and mitigations. A colour-coded risk matrix was used to illustrate the severity of risks. This can be seen documentated below:
