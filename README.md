## Brief

The purpose of this project is to test how well we can apply the DevOps knowledge gained over the last 10 weeks to deploy a pre-developed application. Full freedom of choice on which tools to use has been given to all group members who must work together to meet the project deliverables by following an agile scrum framework.

### Scope

The scope of this project does not cover development of code as we will be working with externally developed applications:

- front-end: https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular
- back-end: https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest

Please find above the repositories for the well documented 'Spring Pet Clinic' application, one  of which serves as a front end client using AngularJS and the other as an API using Java.

### Requirements

The focuses of this project lies on the automation of the development workflows and the successful deployment of the applicaiton. There is no restrictions or requirements on which tools to use although, the reasons for use of each tool should be discussed in an end-of-project presentation accompanied by a demonstration of the workflows developed.
